Unsorted:
 - make the RGUserDialog a dialog with a gtktextview to get a scrolled area
 
 - ask on debian-deity if it is possible to get a "DeletePin" function.
   this way, we can do default release pining without rereading the cache
   (see policy.cc:pkgPolicy::pkgPolicy())

 "Install from multiple Distributions patch":
   - save selected distribution when doing a "save selection"
   - when "open cache" is called, make sure that the correct distribution 
     is selected for save/restore
   - fix "undo/redo"
 
 - download window scrollbar shouldn't always scroll, make two areas, one with
   active jobs and one with completted jobs? 

Configure:
   - allways give the correct path in the synaptic.desktop file
     (currently hardcoded)

GUI:
   - allow clicking in the depedency list so that the click takes
     you to the package
   - add TaskView view to show tasks (add just a new view). 
   - add native debconf reconfigure frontend using the cmdpipe interface
     to debconf (cool!)
   - try to get synaptic into base-config
   - add non-root mode 
   - add something that lets the user see if a certain package is already
     in the cache
   - add reduced view? (always ignore this package)
   - add ignore option for unwanted packages (use RPackageView?!)
   - add context menu in the dependency list to install/remove/upgrade
   - add a dialog that show what dependency is unmet if a pkg can not be
     installed (like ShowBroken() in apt-get.cc)
   - changesWindow should also support installing recommends/suggested pkgs
   - add a sources.list wizard for debian (like base-config)?
   - add context-menu on right-click (del/inst/upgr/show descr in own window,
   - make a the used font in the treeview configurable 
   - add a button to undo all programmed changes 
	(do we need this now that we have a "real" undo?)

Filter:
   - add "immutable" filters that can be configured via /etc/synaptic/filters
   - dependencies of selected package
   - dependents of selected package

General:
   - add something like aptitude Last-change support, so that you can
     track what pkgs where installed to fullfill some dependencies
     (and have the option to remove them again automatically)
     [might be enough to use "remove with dependencies" ?]
   - make deporhan a native synaptic filter (should be easy)
   - make log-file
   - current task support is broken, try to fix it
   - implement raptoptions save/restore for getFlags/setFlags [not needed?]
   - implement font size choser [half-done see FAQ]


Done:
   - add a tab that shows all version of the package 
     (like apt-cache showpkg)
   - enable different sorting methods for the tree (e.g. size)
   - implement proxy settings 
   - implement a new (interactive) search function
   - config option what the default action of ("delete") button is
   - "removed but residual config" should win against 
     "obsolete or locally installed" in by status view
   - add remove with deps menu entry 
   - add "Provides" tab (done)
   - obsolete packages (installed, but no install version available)
     (named "not installable")
   - add missing functionality in rpackagefilter line 183 (Provides filter)
   - display all files of a installed packages (like dpkg -L or apt-file)

   - implement some kind of deborphan functionality (make it a filter)

   - label with short description resizes the gui (ugly)
   - add filters to menu (done)
   - make easy way to filter for description

   - handle "|" case in WDepends (partly)
   - implement "Hold package" (partly)   
   - add man-page and localised man-page (done)
