.SH AUTHORS
Synaptic was originally developed by Alfredo K. Kojima
<kojima@conectiva.com.br>. His last official release was 0.16. Michael
Vogt <mvo@debian.org> took over his CVS version, that already included a
nearly complete port to GTK. Michael completed the port and added new
features. See the \fINEWS\fR file for the user visible changes from
that point on. Conectiva is still involved in the development of
synaptic. Gustavo Niemeyer <niemeyer@conectiva.com> is doing a
great deal of work.
