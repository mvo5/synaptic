// We need a different package manager, since we need to do the
// DoInstall() process in two steps when forking. Without that,
// the forked package manager would be updated with the new
// information, and the original Synaptic process wouldn't be
// aware about it.
//
// Very unfortunately, we *do* need to access stuff which is
// declared as protected in the packagemanager.h header. To do
// that, we need this awful hack. Make sure to include all headers
// included by packagemanager.h before the hack, so that we reduce
// the impact of it. In the future, we must ask the APT maintainers
// to export the functionality we need, so that we may avoid this
// ugly hack.
